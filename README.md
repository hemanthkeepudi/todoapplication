##  How to Run the Application

Follow these steps to clone, configure, and run the Todo Application.

###  Prerequisites

* MySQL 
---

###  Clone the Repository

###  Configure the Database

#### Option 1: Use H2 (Default - In-Memory Database)

No additional configuration is required. The application is pre-configured to use the H2 database.

#### Option 2: Use MySQL 

1. Create a MySQL database named `todoapp`:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE todoapp;
```

2. Open the file: `src/main/resources/application.properties`
3. Replace the default H2 configuration with the following:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/todoapp
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```

Replace `your_username` and `your_password` with your actual MySQL credentials.
